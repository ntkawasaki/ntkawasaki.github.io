            mountain biking, and reading.

          <p class="lead">
            I believe that my strengths and personal interests in Looker align
            perfectly with the qualities needed for this Data Analyst position.
            While I have only had 8 months in total experience at Looker, I have
            demonstrated a level of proficiency in all technical areas involved
            in developing, maintaining, and applying LookML projects to business
            needs.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            My greatest strength, and what I would consider my "superpower" if I
            had one, is my ability and willingness to learn. Two years ago I
            entered the world of programming and technology. To summarize the
            effect in which the programming struggle has had so far, it taught
            me that learning takes a long amount of
            <span style="font-style: italic">time</span>, a genuine
            <span style="font-style: italic">belief in attainment</span>, and
            <span style="font-style: italic">persistence</span>. The acceptance
            that progress in any subject takes time, yet knowing that progress
            will happen as long as you put in persistent effort, is a mindset
            that I can and would apply to projects in the Applications Team
            role. In all honesty I do not have much experience with the
            Applications that you have already created, nor do I know all of our
            blocks inside and out, but I am confident that these are things I
            can quickly become familiar with and even build upon.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            My interests in technology can be boiled down to the desire to
            create solutions that empower people. With respect to Looker only,
            LookML modeling and development is by far my favorite part of the
            software for a couple of reasons. The first is simply that it is fun
            and easy to write. The second, and main reason, is because of what
            it enables other people to do. I have been using Looker for 8 months
            now, so I have become accustomed to how it works and what it does.
            Yet when I see how people react to their first sales demo or I
            explain it to a friend, I remember how great of a solution it is. To
            be able to give analytical power to people who have zero SQL or data
            backgrounds is an incredible service. As I see it, the Applications
            Team is an extension of this empowerment. It gives people analytical
            capability from the
            <span style="font-style: italic">beginning</span> of implementation.
            Because of how my personal interest in Looker aligns with the goal
            of Applications, I would have no trouble fully engaging in my work
            and creating new ways to bring data analytics to the finger tips of
            all people.

            data. The primary challenge was needing to completely reshape a
            denormalized dataset so that it would be usable with SQL. After many
            stressful days of struggle I learned how to use CASE statements,
            UNIONS, and the overall importance of table structure for
            aggregation and filtering. (Some things have changed since last
            year, but the link goes to an example of a derived table)

            Seattle 2017. The project itself was not too complex, but there was
            a time constraint. I did learn how to quickly create and collaborate
            on a project that was of demo worthy. (The Project seems to have
            been taken down)
