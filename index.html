          <p class="lead">
            I recently graduated from UCLA with a degree in Economics, and have
            returned to Looker after a four month summer internship last year.
            Currently I am in my fifteenth week full-time at Looker in the
            Department of Customer Love.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Outside of work, I try to expand my technical knowledge by taking
            online classes in Looker related subjects (Data Science, Web
            Development, AWS), and enjoy partaking in outdoor sports. I am most
            passionate about Wingsuit Skydiving, but also workout at Paradigm
            Sport, surf at 38th, and have recently started mountain biking.
            Lastly, I like to read sci-fi, fantasy, and personal development
            books. Currently I am working through Brandon Sanderson's The
            Stormlight Archive and Mistborn series.

          <p class="lead">
            I believe that my strengths and personal interests in Looker align
            perfectly with the qualities needed for the Applcations Team Data
            Analyst position. While I have only had 8 months in total experience
            at Looker, I have demonstrated a level of proficiency in all
            technical areas involved in developing, maintaining, and applying
            LookML projects to business needs.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            My greatest strength, and what I would consider my "superpower" if I
            had one, is my ability and willingness to learn. Over the past three
            years, I began three activities mostly as hobbies, yet that ended up
            teaching me something much more valuable: how to learn. They are:
            Wingsuit Skydiving, Crossfit, and programming. To quickly summarize
            the effect in which these three hobbies helped me learn how to
            learn, they all take a looong amount of
            <span style="font-weight: bold">time</span>, a genuine
            <span style="font-weight: bold">belief in attainment</span>, and
            <span style="font-weight: bold">persistence</span>. The acceptance
            that progress in any subject takes time, yet know that progress will
            happen as long as you put in persistent effort, is a mindset that I
            can and would be able to apply to the projects in the Applications
            Team role. In all honesty I do not have that much experience with
            the Applications that you have already created, nor do I know all of
            our blocks inside and out, but I am confident that these are
            projects I can quickly become familiar with and even build upon.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            My interests in technology and Looker can be boiled down to the
            desire to build solutions that empower people. With respect to
            Looker only, LookML modeling and development is by far my favorite
            part of Looker for a couple of reasons. The first is simply that it
            is fun and easy to write. The second, and main reason I enjoy
            writing LookML is because of what it enables other people to do. I
            have been using Looker for 8 months now, and so I have become used
            to what it does. Yet when I see how people react to their first
            sales demo or explain it to a friend I remember how incredible of a
            solution it is to be able to give analytical power to people who
            have zero SQL or data backgrounds. As I see it, the Applications
            Team is an extension of this empowerment. It gives people analytical
            power <span style="font-style: italic">from the beginning</span> of
            implementation. Because of how my personal interest in Looker aligns
            with the goal of Applications, I would fully engage myself in
            projects and passionately think of ways to further empower our
            customers in data analytics.
